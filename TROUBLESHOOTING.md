# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue: "Resource not accessible by integration"

This error means the GitHub Actions workflow doesn't have permission to create GitHub Pages sites.

## Root Causes & Solutions

### 1. Repository Settings Issue

**Problem**: Repository doesn't allow GitHub Actions to create Pages
**Solution**: Enable Pages manually first

#### Steps to Fix:
1. Go to: https://github.com/Dhruvish09/ProDeck/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Choose branch: **"main"**
4. Choose folder: **"/ (root)"**
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Wait for Pages to be enabled
7. Then change back to **"GitHub Actions"**

### 2. Repository Type Issue

**Problem**: Private repositories have limited Pages support
**Solution**: Check repository visibility

#### Check:
- Go to repository Settings â†’ General
- Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
- Check if repository is Public or Private
- **Note**: Private repos need GitHub Pro for Pages

### 3. Organization Settings Issue

**Problem**: Organization repositories have restricted permissions
**Solution**: Check organization settings

#### Check:
- Go to organization settings (if applicable)
- Look for Pages or Actions restrictions
- Contact organization admin if needed

### 4. GitHub Actions Permission Issue

**Problem**: Workflow doesn't have right permissions
**Solution**: Use the simplified workflow

#### Use This Instead:
- The `.github/workflows/deploy-simple.yml` workflow
- It has minimal, focused permissions
- Should work better with existing Pages setup

## Immediate Actions

### Option 1: Manual Pages Setup (Recommended)
1. Enable Pages manually as described above
2. Use the simplified workflow
3. This bypasses the permission issue

### Option 2: Use Simplified Workflow
1. The `deploy-simple.yml` workflow is more reliable
2. It focuses only on deployment
3. Less likely to have permission conflicts

### Option 3: Check Repository Status
1. Verify repository is public
2. Check if you have admin access
3. Ensure no organization restrictions

## Alternative Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended Alternative)
- Free hosting
- Better for Next.js apps
- Automatic deployments
- No permission issues

### Netlify
- Free hosting
- Good for static sites
- Easy setup
- Reliable deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Try manual Pages setup first**
2. **Use the simplified workflow**
3. **If still failing, consider Vercel/Netlify**
4. **Check repository permissions and settings**
